                    <h3>1. ***What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work and where should we store them on the client-side?</h3>
                    <p>-- A refresh token just helps you re-validate a user without them having to re-enter their login credentials multiple times. The access token is re-issued, provided the refresh token is a valid one requesting permission to access confidential resources.</p>
                    <h3>2.***Compare SQL and NoSQL databases?</h3>
                    <p>-- SQL databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores. SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.</p>
                    <h3>3.***What is express js? What is NestJS ?</h3>
                    <p>--Express is a minimalist and flexible framework that is easy to use and has a large community of developers. NestJS, on the other hand, is a newer framework that provides additional features such as dependency injection, a modular architecture, and an intuitive CLI.</p>
                    <h3>4.***What is MongoDB aggregate and how does it work?</h3>
                    <p>--What is Aggregation in MongoDB? Aggregation is a way of processing a large number of documents in a collection by means of passing them through different stages. The stages make up what is known as a pipeline. The stages in a pipeline can filter, sort, group, reshape and modify documents that pass through the pipeline.</p>
